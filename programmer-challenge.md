# UofL Integrative Design and Development - Programmer Coding Challenge
# Overview
The following coding challenge is designed to assess your skills in web developing, AI / Machine Learning integration, and collaborative development practices.

# Challenge:
The challenge is to take the included data set, labeled "catalog dev", which is a copy of our course catalog in .csv (comma separated values) format, and to render it into a series of cards that display the Subject, Catalog Number and Description.

For Example, a card may render:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PHIL 459 - Philosophy of Technology │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

At minimum please develop a front page that displays an overall title for the page, "UofL Course Catalog", and renders 10 cards therein with the specified information - Subject, Catalog Number and Description.

Translating the data into a web readable format, such as JSON, should take a script written or package used to translate the data from .csv to JSON.

Extra work includes a search bar under the title, wherein the user can type in an input and expect that it matches the course title. For instance if the user were to type, "Philosophy of Technology", they would expect the "Philosophy of Technology" card to render.
